            <p>I am 17 years old and ever since i was young I had been dreaming about my future and it 
                has always been me becoming a programmer or maybe a doctor but the older i got the more sure i became that 
                i want to be a programmer that was because of our highschool teacher that has taught me how to love
                learing how to code and how it can be fun and entertaing it almost feels like i am taking a break from everything and 
                just enjoying my self instead of coding that isn't to that it is perfect and that i am spend 
                everyminute of it just having fun but as frustrating as it can be i love it just as much 
                besides these i enjoy spending my lesiure time reading books and listening to musics and sometimes
                going out to have some fun with friends.
